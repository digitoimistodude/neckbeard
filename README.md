# neckbeard [![Designed for WooCommerce](http://img.shields.io/badge/Designed%20for-WooCommerce-a46497.svg)](http://woothemes.com/woocommerce/)

neckbeard is a WordPress starter theme based on [neckbeard](https://github.com/woothemes/neckbeard) by woothemes and [_s](https://github.com/automattic/_s) by Automattic.

More documentation coming soon.

## What's NOT inside

- No customizer (this is dev-theme, not a theme for all)
- No welcome screen (see above)
- No Jetpack stuff (see above)
- No bourbon (mostly bloat and useless mixins, like compass)
- No child theme support (this is going to be a starter theme for devs)
- Gulp instead of Grunt (simpler to read, newer)

## TODO

- [ ] Add devpackages
- [x] Remove bourbon
- [x] Add normalize.scss
