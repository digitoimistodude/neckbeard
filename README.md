More documentation coming soon.

## What's NOT inside

- No customizer (this is dev-theme, not a theme for everyone)
- No welcome screen (see above)
- No Jetpack stuff (see above)
- No bourbon (mostly bloat and useless mixins, like compass)
- No child theme support (this is going to be a starter theme for devs)
- No sidebar (mostly not needed, building it separately if that's the case)
- No widgets (see above)
